and the distance (Euclidean distance).

/* Medoid main idea: To find the medoid of the Graph we just keep the 5% of the nodes of Graph as sample nodes and check
for a possible medoid in those nodes. When we find a possible medoid, we search in the neighbors of this possible medoid 
to check for a "better" possible medoid (if there is). If we find a "better" possible medoid we save it and continue
searching the new possible medoid's neighbors until we can't find a "better" medoid. That means we found the medoid of 
the Graph.

This algorithm checks for the medoid of a Graph using "Brute Force" method but only on the nodes it considers important. 
Î¤ries "in a sample way" to find the correct result and reduce complexity of "Brute Force" method as much as possible.

NOTE: this algorithm works better in graphs with a lot of neighbors in every node.
